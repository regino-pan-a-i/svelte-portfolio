            <h2>Fullstack Developer</h2>

        <p>I’m a software engineering student with a passion for creating digital experiences that people genuinely enjoy and find useful. My background blends technical skills with hands-on marketing experience, giving me a unique perspective on how to design and build solutions that are both functional and impactful. From developing full-stack web apps with the MERN stack, to building iOS apps in Swift, to crafting Chrome extensions in 24-hour hackathons, I love tackling challenges and turning ideas into products that make life easier. Every project I work on is an opportunity to learn, experiment, and deliver something that not only works—but also creates real value for its users.</p>

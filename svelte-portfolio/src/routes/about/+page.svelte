    <p>I’m a senior Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University–Idaho with a 3.95 GPA, graduating in December 2025. I’m passionate about building meaningful, user-centered software solutions and have a strong foundation in Java, full-stack web development, and mobile app development. Over the past few years, I’ve completed projects ranging from a class planning tool using the MERN stack to a Spring Boot e-commerce platform with real-time cart cleanup using multithreading and MongoDB. I recently earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, expanding my skills into cloud-based deployment and DevOps.

        I’ve participated in several hackathons, including HackUSU, where I helped develop a Chrome extension that improves reading accessibility with AI-powered summaries and Q&A. These high-pressure, collaborative environments taught me to think clearly, prioritize what matters most, and turn ideas into working products in under 24 hours. I also lead web analytics efforts at my university, improving user engagement and data tracking through hands-on scripting, integration, and A/B testing.
        
        Beyond coding, I love mentoring and helping others grow. I’ve led onboarding and training efforts as a team lead and am eager to support fellow students in understanding core Java concepts, from OOP to Spring Boot. Whether it’s breaking down a complex error message or explaining the difference between interfaces and abstract classes, I find joy in guiding others through the learning process. I’m currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute, teach, and continue building impactful software with great teams.</p>
